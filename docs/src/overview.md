# OWLOGGER

## The Mystery: 

__What's happening in your attic, your server rack, your fermenting cellar, your chicken coop?__ You need answers, but the conventional path to remote monitoring is fragile and insecure:

## The Problem:

* __Digital Doorways__: Direct inbound connections are a security vulnerability you want to avoid
* __Flaky Connections__: Intermittent internet means intermittent data â€“ including trends before the outage
* __Elusive IP__: Your IP address is dynamically supplied and can change at any time -- usually when service disruptions make insight most critical
* __A Web of Sensors__: Managing dozens of individual access points is a logistical nightmare
* __Phone apps are dangerous__: They can be spooffed, and you don't know what else they are doing
* __Vendor lock-in__: Proprietary sensors and services can be abandoned. And the subscription price increases

## The Game Changer: Forget complex network configurations and security risks. What if you could have real-time, consolidated insights, all funneled securely through an easily affordable cloud server.

* __These__ devices are under your total control
* __Inexpensive__ Even the cloud server is cheap
  * __Virtual Private Server (VPS)__ available from many providers. Full access to a virtual cloud computer
  * Storage, Web access, and any services you want (e.g. `owlogger` or web store)
  * Example: [Kamatera](https://www.kamatera.com/products/cloud-servers/) is $4/month
  * We give complete instructions on setting up owlogger on a VPS 
* __Pure Web browser__: Your data is available from any internet browser without installing software. You phone, pad or computer. Even a smart TV

## The Core:

* __Robust 1-Wire Sensors__: Your dependable data gatherers
* A Pint-Sized __Transmitter__: A smart device (think a Raspberry Pi) that acts as the local data collection point

## The owlogger Advantage: 

This powerful system ensures a one-way, secure data flow out to your cloud, giving you uncompromised access without compromising your security. 1-wire sensors are time-tested (decades in continuous use) and the software open-source.
