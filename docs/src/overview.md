# Overview

## Problem:

1. You have something you want to monitor/inspect -- say the basement temperature.
2. You have power and aan internet connection.
3. You don't want to connect directly from the outside into your space
  * Security concerns
  * Intermittent connectivity
  * No constant IP address
  * Too many sensor locations to access individually
4. You have an accessible cloud server
  * Can be found for as little  $4/mo 

The solution is 1-wire sensors, a small tranmitting machine (?raspberry pi), and the __owlogger__ system
