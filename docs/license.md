# License

There are several components used (but included directly) with slightly different licences.

## Summary

Open source, and may be employed as you wish. Licensing cannot change. Some parts require that distributing derived software must also offer the source code be available

# Details

## owlogger.py owpost.py

[MIT license](https://github.com/alfille/owlogger) -- basically code may be used for any purpose, but should stay under that license and offers no warrantees.

## air-datepicker

[MIT licence](https://github.com/t1m0n/air-datepicker)

## pyownet

[LGPL-3.0](https://github.com/miccoli/pyownet) -- read the details [here.](https://github.com/miccoli/pyownet?tab=LGPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme)

----

So the licensing is quite permissive. Treating the entirety as LGPL-3.0 is probably the safest course, but the individual components are licensed as stated above.
